# Mininet_Project
A set of scripts for computer networking in Mininet

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
*******************
The topic for the team project this semester is to implement a simple IP router using mininet, so please go ahead and start researching about it and discuss among team members on how to tackle the project.

Requirements, rubrics and starting code base for the project can be found here:

If there is any conflicting information between this site and the mininet wiki use information from this site.

Submission Requirements:
At the end of the semester, EACH student must submit a ZIP file containing
1. A project report (in Word format) covering
a) a description of the program,
b) the challenges that you and your team had  and how did you or the team overcome them,
c) what you have learned by doing the project,
d) a discussion about algorithms and techniques used in the program,
e) contributions of each team member,
and f) any suggestions you may have (optional).
2. A short video clip demonstrating the router in action. (If the video is too big you can post it on a website, e.g. youTube, and submit the link).
3. All code that are needed to run your program.
4. A document describing your team's implementation of the router.
Obviously items 2. 3 and 4. are the same for all team members but item 1. must be prepared by each student individually (but some sections of the report, e.g. a) and d), can be shared).
Let me or the TA know if there is any questions or comments.
Teams should get together as soon as possible to discuss the requirements and decide on how to break down the task to assign to each team member.
